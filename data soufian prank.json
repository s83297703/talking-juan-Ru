        "text_Content": "In a game of Talking Juan, there are 3 rounds of play. Each round, the players will be assigned a random card. The goal of each round is to be the first player to successfully “call” the card. Once the round begins, the players will take turns guessing the card that was assigned to them. For example, if the assigned card is the Jack of Hearts, then the players will have to guess “Jack of Hearts” to call the round. If one player calls the round before all the other players have had a turn, then they will win the round and receive 2 points. If 2 or more players call the round at the same time, then no one wins the round and it ends in a “standoff”. No points will be awarded in this situation. If no one calls the round within 3 turns, the round ends in a “tie”. The cards played during the round are then discarded, and no points are awarded. As you can see, there is a lot more to Talking Juan than simply guessing the card. This article will now move on to provide beginners with some tips and tricks that can help them win more rounds.",

        "text_Content": "Since a player’s hand is secret in Talking Juan, there is a lot of information that a beginner can use against their opponents. This gives the beginner an inherent advantage, but it’s important to remember that there are plenty of ways to lose an advantage. In the first round, there is a chance that a beginner may draw a card that will give them a huge advantage, such as the 6-of-Clubs, which gives a player the ability to guess any card without being wrong. While this is great for them, it’s important that they don’t get too confident. Since a player’s hand is secret, it is possible that they drew the 6-of-Clubs in the first round, but they could also have it in their hand in the second or third round. In this situation, they could accidentally reveal their hand and show their card, which would give away their advantage.",

        "text_Content": "If you’ve played Talking Juan for a while and feel like you’ve mastered the basics of the game, this section is for you. Now that you have a better understanding of the game and what it takes to win a round, it’s time to look at the more complex strategies that will help you win the game. In order to win the game, you will need to win a certain amount of rounds. This will require you to use a strategic approach with your play so that you can get the most points out of each round. One thing that you will want to do is make sure that you are playing to your strengths. If you are playing against a friend, you will want to choose the round that you will be most successful in. It may not be the round that gives you the most points, but it will give you the best chance to win. If you are playing against an unknown opponent, then you will want to choose the round that gives you the most points. You will want to do this because you won’t know the other player’s strategy and you want to get as many points as possible. Another important thing to remember is that you want to attack the weak players. In a 3-person game, each player will have 2 opportunities to win a round. This means that each player will have 2 chances to lose a round. If you can pick out the player who appears to be least capable of winning, you will want to go after them. This will put you one step closer to winning the game.",
